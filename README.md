# Sample-Podcasts

A number of sample podcasts for testing RSS parser and other podcasts / player software.

The podcasts live on localhost. These are static files which have the URLs inside the RSS, so you need to place them in the matching locations.

The RSS files have the URLs:

* http://localhost/Sample-Podcasts/podcast-counting.rss
* http://localhost/Sample-Podcasts/podcast-alphabet.rss

The folders containing the MP3 files have the locations:

* http://localhost/Sample-Podcasts/zero2ten/
* http://localhost/Sample-Podcasts/a2z/
